<h1>Modified Apache Contributor License Agreement v2.0<a class="headerlink" href="#modified-apache-contributor-license-agreement-v2-0" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Thank you for your interest in the <strong>Chair for VLSI Design, Diagnostics
and Architecture</strong> - Faculty of Computer Science, Technische Universität
Dresden, Germany (the “Chair”). In order to clarify the intellectual
property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the
Chair must have a Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”) on file that has
been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license
terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as
well as the protection of the Chair and its users; it does not
change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.</p>
<p>The following CLA is an adaption of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf">Apache Contributor License Agreement v2.0</a></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your
present and future Contributions submitted to the Chair. In
return, the Chair shall not use Your Contributions in a way that
is contrary to the public benefit or inconsistent with its nonprofit
status and bylaws in effect at the time of the Contribution. Except
for the license granted herein to the Chair and recipients of
software distributed by the Chair, You reserve all right, title,
and interest in and to Your Contributions.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Definitions.</strong> <br />
<em>“You”</em> (or <em>“Your”</em>) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement
with the Chair. For legal entities, the entity making a
Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled
by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to
be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,
<em>“control”</em> means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p>
<p><em>“Contribution”</em> shall mean any original work of authorship,
including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
is intentionally submitted by You to the Chair for inclusion
in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by
the Chair (the <em>“Work”</em>). For the purposes of this definition,
“submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
communication sent to the Chair or its representatives,
including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
are managed by, or on behalf of, the Chair for the purpose of
discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that
is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You
as <strong>“Not a Contribution.”</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Grant of Copyright License.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Chair and to
recipients of software distributed by the Chair a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
Contributions and such derivative works.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grant of Patent License.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Chair and to
recipients of software distributed by the Chair a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any
entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed,
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for
that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.</p></li>
<li><p>You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above
license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property
that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent
that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf
of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for
your Contributions to the Chair, or that your employer has
executed a separate <a class="reference internal" href="ApacheLicense2.0_CCLA.html"><span class="doc">Corporate CLA</span></a>
with the Chair.</p></li>
<li><p>You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You
represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete
details of any third-party license or other restriction (including,
but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you
are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your
Contributions.</p></li>
<li><p>You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your
Contributions on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p></li>
<li><p>Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
You may submit it to the Chair separately from any
Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of
any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to,
related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you
are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as
<strong>“Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]”</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>You agree to notify the Chair of any facts or circumstances of
which you become aware that would make these representations
inaccurate in any respect.</p></li>
