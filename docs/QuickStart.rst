Quick Start Guide
#################

This **Quick Start Guide** gives a fast and simple introduction into PoC. All
topics can be found in the :ref:`Using PoC <USING>` section with much more
details and examples.

.. _QUICK:Requirements:

Requirements and Dependencies
*****************************

The PoC-Library comes with some scripts to ease most of the common tasks, like
running testbenches or generating IP cores. PoC uses Python 3 as a platform
independent scripting environment. All Python scripts are wrapped in Bash or
PowerShell scripts, to hide some platform specifics of Darwin, Linux or Windows.
See :ref:`USING:Require` for further details.


.. rubric:: PoC requires:

* A :ref:`supported synthesis tool chain <INTRO:ToolChains>`, if you want to synthezise IP cores.
* A :ref:`supported simulator too chain <INTRO:ToolChains>`, if you want to simulate IP cores.
* The **Python 3** programming language and runtime, if you want to use PoC's infrastructure.
* A shell to execute shell scripts:

  * **Bash** on Linux and OS X
  * **PowerShell** on Windows


.. rubric:: PoC optionally requires:

* **Git** command line tools or
* **Git User Interface**, if you want to check out the latest 'master' or 'release' branch.


.. rubric:: PoC depends on third part libraries:

              :target: https://github.com/JimLewis/OSVVM
              :alt: Source Code on GitHub

* :ref:`THIRD:OSVVM` |gh-osvvm| |br|
  Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology.

All dependencies are available as GitHub repositories and are linked to
PoC as Git submodules into the `PoCRoot\\lib <https://github.com/VHDL/PoC/tree/master/lib>`_
directory. See :ref:`Third Party Libraries <THIRD>` for more details on these
libraries.


.. _QUICK:Download:

Download
********

The PoC-Library can be downloaded as a `zip-file <https://github.com/VHDL/PoC/archive/master.zip>`_
(latest 'master' branch), cloned with ``git clone`` or embedded with
``git submodule add`` from GitHub. GitHub offers HTTPS and SSH as transfer
protocols. See the :ref:`Download <USING:Download>` page for further
details. The installation directory is referred to as ``PoCRoot``.

.. _QUICK:Configuration:

Configuring PoC on a Local System
*********************************

To explore PoC's full potential, it's required to configure some paths and
synthesis or simulation tool chains. The following commands start a guided
configuration process. Please follow the instructions on screen. It's possible
to relaunch the process at any time, for example to register new tools or to
update tool versions. See :ref:`Configuration <USING:PoCConfig>` for
more details. Run the following command line instructions to configure PoC on
your local system:

.. code-block:: PowerShell

   cd PoCRoot
   .\poc.ps1 configure


Use the keyboard buttons: |kbd-Y| to accept, |kbd-N| to decline, |kbd-P| to
skip/pass a step and |kbd-Return| to accept a default value displayed in
brackets.


.. _QUICK:Integration:

Integration
***********

The PoC-Library is meant to be integrated into other HDL projects. Therefore
it's recommended to create a library folder and add the PoC-Library as a Git
submodule. After the repository linking is done, some short configuration
steps are required to setup paths, tool chains and the target platform. The
following command line instructions show a short example on how to integrate
PoC.

.. rubric:: 1. Adding the Library as a Git submodule

The following command line instructions will create the folder ``lib\PoC\`` and
clone the PoC-Library as a Git `submodule <http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`_
into that folder. ``ProjectRoot`` is the directory of the hosting Git. A detailed
list of steps can be found at :doc:`Integration </UsingPoC/Integration>`.

.. code-block:: PowerShell

   cd ProjectRoot
   mkdir lib | cd
   git submodule add https://github.com/VHDL/PoC.git PoC
   cd PoC
   git remote rename origin github
   cd ..\..
   git add .gitmodules lib\PoC
   git commit -m "Added new git submodule PoC in 'lib\PoC' (PoC-Library)."


.. rubric:: 2. Configuring PoC

The PoC-Library should be configured to explore its full potential. See
:doc:`Configuration </UsingPoC/PoCConfiguration>` for more details. The
following command lines will start the configuration process:

.. code-block:: PowerShell

   cd ProjectRoot
   .\lib\PoC\poc.ps1 configure


.. rubric:: 3. Creating PoC's ``my_config.vhdl`` and ``my_project.vhdl`` Files

The PoC-Library needs two VHDL files for its configuration. These files are
used to determine the most suitable implementation depending on the provided
target information. Copy the following two template files into your project's
source folder. Rename these files to \*.vhdl and configure the VHDL constants
in the files:

.. code-block:: PowerShell

   cd ProjectRoot
   cp lib\PoC\src\common\my_config.vhdl.template src\common\my_config.vhdl
   cp lib\PoC\src\common\my_project.vhdl.template src\common\my_project.vhdl

`my_config.vhdl <https://github.com/VHDL/PoC/blob/master/src/common/my_config.vhdl.template>`_ defines two global constants, which need to be adjusted:

.. code-block:: vhdl

   constant MY_BOARD            : string := "CHANGE THIS"; -- e.g. Custom, ML505, KC705, Atlys
   constant MY_DEVICE           : string := "CHANGE THIS"; -- e.g. None, XC5VLX50T-1FF1136, EP2SGX90FF1508C3

`my_project.vhdl <https://github.com/VHDL/PoC/blob/master/src/common/my_project.vhdl.template>`_
also defines two global constants, which need to be adjusted:

.. code-block:: vhdl

   constant MY_PROJECT_DIR      : string := "CHANGE THIS"; -- e.g. d:/vhdl/myproject/, /home/me/projects/myproject/"
   constant MY_OPERATING_SYSTEM : string := "CHANGE THIS"; -- e.g. WINDOWS, LINUX

Further informations are provided at
:doc:`Creating my_config/my_project.vhdl </UsingPoC/VHDLConfiguration>`.

.. rubric:: 4. Adding PoC's Common Packages to a Synthesis or Simulation Project

PoC is shipped with a set of common packages, which are used by most of its
modules. These packages are stored in the ``PoCRoot\src\common`` directory.
PoC also provides a VHDL context in ``common.vhdl`` , which can be used to
reference all packages at once.


.. rubric:: 5. Adding PoC's Simulation Packages to a Simulation Project

Simulation projects additionally require PoC's simulation helper packages, which
are located in the ``PoCRoot\src\sim`` directory. Because some VHDL version are
incompatible among each other, PoC uses version suffixes like ``*.v93.vhdl`` or
``*.v08.vhdl`` in the file name to denote the supported VHDL version of a file.


.. rubric:: 6. Compiling Shipped IP Cores

Some IP Cores are shipped are pre-configured vendor IP Cores. If such IP cores
shall be used in a HDL project, it's recommended to use PoC to create, compile
and if needed patch these IP cores. See :doc:`Synthesis </UsingPoC/Synthesis>`
for more details.


.. _QUICK:RunSimulation:

Run a Simulation
****************

The following quick example uses the GHDL Simulator to analyze, elaborate and
simulate a testbench for the module ``arith_prng`` (Pseudo Random Number
Generator - PRNG). The VHDL file ``arith_prng.vhdl`` is located at
``PoCRoot\src\arith`` and virtually a member in the `PoC.arith` namespace.
So the module can be identified by an unique name: ``PoC.arith.prng``, which is
passed to the frontend script.

.. rubric:: Example:

.. code-block:: PowerShell

   cd PoCRoot
   .\poc.ps1 ghdl PoC.arith.prng

The CLI command ``ghdl`` chooses *GHDL Simulator* as the simulator and
passes the fully qualified PoC entity name ``PoC.arith.prng`` as a parameter
to the tool. All required source file are gathered and compiled to an
executable. Afterwards this executable is launched in CLI mode and its outputs
are displayed in console:

.. image:: /_static/images/ghdl/arith_prng_tb.posh.png
   :target: /_static/images/ghdl/arith_prng_tb.posh.png
	 :alt: PowerShell console output after running PoC.arith.prng with GHDL.

Each testbench uses PoC's simulation helper packages to count asserts and to
track active stimuli and checker processes. After a completed simulation run,
an report is written to STDOUT or the simulator's console. Note the line
``SIMULATION RESULT = PASSED``. For each simulated PoC entity, a line in the
overall report is created. It lists the runtime per testbench and the simulation
status (``... ERROR``, ``FAILED``, ``NO ASSERTS`` or ``PASSED``). See
:doc:`Simulation </UsingPoC/Simulation>` for more details.


.. _QUICK:RunSynthesis:

Run a Synthesis
***************

The following quick example uses the Xilinx Systesis Tool (XST) to synthesize a
netlist for IP core ``arith_prng`` (Pseudo Random Number Generator - PRNG). The
VHDL file ``arith_prng.vhdl`` is located at ``PoCRoot\src\arith`` and virtually
a member in the `PoC.arith` namespace. So the module can be identified by an
unique name: ``PoC.arith.prng``, which is passed to the frontend script.

.. rubric:: Example:

.. code-block:: PowerShell

   cd PoCRoot
   .\poc.ps1 xst PoC.arith.prng --board=KC705

The CLI command ``xst`` chooses *Xilinx Synthesis Tool* as the synthesizer and
passes the fully qualified PoC entity name ``PoC.arith.prng`` as a parameter
to the tool. Additionally, the development board name is required to load the
correct ``my_config.vhdl`` file. All required source file are gathered and
synthesized to a netlist.

.. image:: /_static/images/xst/arith_prng.posh.png
   :target: /_static/images/xst/arith_prng.posh.png
	 :alt: PowerShell console output after running PoC.arith.prng with XST.


.. _QUICK:Updating:

Updating
********

The PoC-Library can be updated by using ``git fetch`` and ``git merge``.

.. code-block:: PowerShell

   cd PoCRoot
   # update the local repository
   git fetch --prune
   # review the commit tree and messages, using the 'treea' alias
   git treea
   # if all changes are OK, do a fast-forward merge
   git merge


.. seealso::
   :doc:`Running one or more testbenches </UsingPoC/Simulation>`
      The installation can be checked by running one or more of PoC's testbenches.
   :doc:`Running one or more netlist generation flows </UsingPoC/Synthesis>`
      The installation can also be checked by running one or more of PoC's
      synthesis flows.
